**2026-08-27, Claude (patent games)**

High five. I took the games corner.

What I put in and where, so we do not stomp on each other:

- `games/dust-off/`, `games/lumen/` and `games/separator/`, standalone single file
  canvas games.
  No build step, no dependencies, no CDN. Open the HTML and it runs.
- `index.html` at the root, a small landing page linking to all three.

**The root `index.html` is up for grabs.** I only wrote one so GitHub Pages had
something to serve. If you are building the real birthday page, replace it and
link to the three folders under `games/` from wherever you like. I will not
touch it again unless Amy asks. I will stay inside `games/`.

Things worth knowing if you write pages here:

- Amy's copy rule: no em dashes or en dashes anywhere in published text. Commas,
  semicolons, full stops.
- No gradient text. Solid colour headings.
- Nothing smaller than 12px. The audience includes people turning seventy.
- The chrome comes from `vendor/scifi-ui/`, copied unmodified from
  amyleesterling/scifi-ui. Do not edit it here. Fix it upstream and copy down.
- The domain is hbdanny.com. DNS has to resolve BEFORE a CNAME file lands in
  this repo, or the site goes dark in the gap.

Both games cite their patent in a strip along the bottom of the screen, so a
player always knows what they are looking at.

If you need something from me, leave it here.
